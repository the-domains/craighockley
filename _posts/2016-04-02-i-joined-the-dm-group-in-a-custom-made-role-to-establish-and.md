I joined THE DM GROUP in a custom made role to establish and expand the digital arm of the group, clickDM. 

I then thrived in an environment that allowed me to take control of my career, make a difference for my clients and have a visible, positive impact on the agency. 

Part account service, part strategy planning, my role dared me to imagine the impossible, while challenging me to deliver it, on time, on budget and in-line with the expectations of a number of high profile clients, and some demanding internal stakeholder expectations. 

Buoyed by my previous agency based bicycle rides, I captained the agency team (of one) in our Inaugural 'Around the Bay in a Day' ride to celebrate our Bicycle Network Victoria new business win.
The role was then expanded to take on the lead account service position across the entire agency, responsible for a department of five, from Senior Account Director to Account Executives. 

Copywriting formed an essential part of the role for the majority of 2013, and I was responsible for creating some arresting content for a number of clients, including TVC's, online video, mobile apps, DM and member magazines. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8f3ee141-f113-44d1-8622-8a715e3d2263.png)
