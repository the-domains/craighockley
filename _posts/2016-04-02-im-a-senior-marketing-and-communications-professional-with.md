I'm a senior marketing and communications professional with a passion for making big ideas burst into life. 

For over 17 years, I've helped some of Australia's biggest brands communicate all sorts of messages to all sorts of people. I've sold shopping centres, nappies, cars, canned fish, blocks of land and power tools. I've encouraged people to work safer, drive safer, have regular eye tests and stay (or get) healthy. I've raised money for sick and underprivileged kids in Australia and secured sponsorships for underprivileged kids in the developing world. I've helped millions of working Australians secure a stronger financial future, and uncovered some amazing places for them to holiday. I've even encouraged them to get out and play golf, ride their bike and catch a train. And that's just the beginning. 

I've worked above the line, below the line and I've blurred the line. I've used data to guide decisions and uncover insights in all communications channels. From TV, press, radio and outdoor to digital, direct, mobile and more, whatever gets the right result, at the right time, is what I'm focused on. 

I build relationships that last. With clients, with colleagues, with suppliers. Successful relationships are at the core of what I do. I've worked with some amazing people. With some I've won awards. With others I've learned how to do things better. With all, I've had fun chasing big ideas, and bringing them to life.
